From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
The intent of this project was to recreate the Google Homepage on an aesthetic level using the basic HTML and CSS knowledge I have acquired in the last few days. 
Through this project I have learned how to layout and add simple functions to a webpage on a basic level using HTML. I have also learned how to style HTML elements using CSS.
